{"id":3928224862,"number":4,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Create CI/CD workflow","body":"As a software engineer\nI want to create a basic github CI/CD workflow to build and test the application\nSo that I can have confidence in the code and a simple way to download the release binary \n\nGiven AntTP Monitor supports multiple target platforms\nWhen building AntTP Monitor\nThen ensure that x86_64-unknown-linux-musl, x86_64-pc-windows-gnu and aarch64-unknown-linux-musl are built\nAnd user https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traktion/antftp/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml as a foundation to replace the existing (limited) workflow\n\nGiven the test suit should be run after build is successful\nWhen building AntTP Monitor\nThen run unit tests on x86_64-unknown-linux-musl build\n\nGiven each build will create fresh binaries\nWhen completing the build process\nThen create a draft release, using notes of commits since the last non-draft release, and provide the above binaries for download\n\nImplementation Notes\n\n- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code\n- Increment patch version of AntTP Monitor package in Cargo.toml\n- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)","author_association":"OWNER","user":{"login":"traktion","id":12068792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDY4Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12068792?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/traktion","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traktion/subscriptions"},"labels":[{"id":10187430882,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/traktion/anttp-monitor/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","description":"New
