{"id":3928220102,"number":3,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Update command times to reflect the state machine","body":"As an AntTP operator\nI want to only show the time waiting in each state\nSo that I can understand how long a command waited, how long it was running and how long ago it terminated or aborted\n\nGiven there is a state change when the state is changed from empty/null to an epoch time (in milliseconds)\nWhen a state change occurs\nThen stop the prior state counter, by subtracting the old state time from the new state time\nAnd render the time in seconds.milliseconds (e.g. 1.1234)\n\nGiven that these state time changes should apply to all screens\nWhen the changes are applied\nThen both the primary and extended details window will reflect the state changes and running times\n\nImplementation Notes\n\n- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml\n- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)\n- Create basic unit tests for new code to validate behaviour\n\nExample states:\n\nwaiting -\u0026gt;
