As an AntTP operator
I want to understand which tasks are in the command queue, which are running, which failed and which terminated successfully
So that I can understand how AntTP is performing

Given 'top' is an existing classic Unix CLI utility for showing what processes are running, with their resource usage
When building AntTP monitor
Then take inspiration from 'top', but instead of showing processes, show the commands queued in AntTP
And use Rust as the language using a standard directory structure
And use Ratatui library to build the TUI
And call the executable anttpmon

Given AntTP has a gRPC endpoint for listing commands
When integrating AntTP monitor with AntTP
Then retrieve the proto file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traktion/AntTP/refs/heads/master/proto/command.proto
And attempt to connect to AntTp using gRPC over http://localhost:18887

Given there should be a default view
When launching
Then show all waiting or running commands by default
And provide vertical and horizontal scrolling to see all of the command and their details
And include the ID (in shortened form, show first and last 3 digits, separated by .., e.g. 123..987)
And include the name and state as strings
And include the waiting_at, running_at and terminated_at (which are epoch values) as which are rendered as the number of seconds difference from the current time (or '-' if null/empty)

Given there should be an extended view window
When a row / command is selected with cursor keys and 'enter' is pressed to select a command
Then an overlay window should render, with the complete details of the command
And this includes ID (full format), name, state, waiting_at, running_at, terminated_at
And also the properties, which should be listed as key/value pairs
And pressing 'enter' again or the 'back' cursor should close the extended view window 

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'c' is pressed
Then show all of the 'completed' commands in the main window

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'a' is pressed
Then show all of the 'aborted' commands in the main window

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'r' is pressed
Then show all of the 'running' commands in the main window

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'w' is pressed
Then show all of the 'waiting' commands in the main window

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'A' is pressed
Then show all of the commands in the main window

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'd' is pressed
Then show all of the default view of commands in the main window

Given there should be multiple modes which can be selected through key presses
When 'q' is pressed
Then quit the application gracefully

Implementation Notes

- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Create basic unit tests for new code to validate behaviour
