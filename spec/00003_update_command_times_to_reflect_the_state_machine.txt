As an AntTP operator
I want to only show the time waiting in each state
So that I can understand how long a command waited, how long it was running and how long ago it terminated or aborted

Given there is a state change when the state is changed from empty/null to an epoch time (in milliseconds)
When a state change occurs
Then stop the prior state counter, by subtracting the old state time from the new state time
And render the time in seconds.milliseconds (e.g. 1.1234)

Given that these state time changes should apply to all screens
When the changes are applied
Then both the primary and extended details window will reflect the state changes and running times

Implementation Notes

- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Create basic unit tests for new code to validate behaviour

Example states:

waiting -> running -> completed

Example time logic:

current time: 1770846698
waiting_at: 1770836575 
running_at:
terminated_at:

waiting: 10.123
running:
completed:

--

current time: 1770840000
waiting_at: 1770810000 
running_at: 1770820000
terminated_at:

waiting: 10.000
running: 20.000
completed:

--

current time: 1770850000
waiting_at: 1770810000 
running_at: 1770820000
terminated_at: 1770830000

waiting: 10.000
running: 10.000
completed: 20.000
