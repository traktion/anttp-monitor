As an AntFTP user
I want some basic documentation on usage, including what commands are available
So that it is easy for me to use the application

Given there are keyboard operations within the application
When providing documentation
Then include what keyboard commands are available
And describe what the application is useful for
And explain how it connects to a local AntTP instance

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
